# Outer Continental Shelf Energy Analytics

[OCSEA](https://gff856e6c70bc1a-afadb1.adb.us-chicago-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/r/ocs/ocsea) is primarily a personal learning project and a tool I'll be using as an observer of the oil and gas industry to gain insight into BSEE's publicly available federal offshore [data](https://www.data.bsee.gov/).

It's built with [Oracle APEX](https://apex.oracle.com/en/) (low-code front end framework) and hosted for free on [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/).

(This website is also hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).)
