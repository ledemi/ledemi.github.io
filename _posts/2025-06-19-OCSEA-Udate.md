I added measurement locations to [OCSEA](https://gff856e6c70bc1a-afadb1.adb.us-chicago-1.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/r/ocs/ocsea)!  

Navigate to any platform and click on the magnifying glass in the "Meas Loc" column. 

Clicking the button at the bottom of the page will launch the full Measurement Locations page.

The list of values automatically populates with the leases and unit participating areas that are approved for measurement on the selected platform.
